# WPF App Launching Universal App

This sample demostrates a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) app launching 
or deep linking into a Universal Windows App (UWA). To run
the sample you will need Visual Studio 2015 and the Windows 10 SDK. Both of these
can be found at <http://developer.windows.com>.

With Visual Studio, open the solution WPFAppLaunchingUniversalApp.sln. A detailed
description of this sample is available

Feel free to submit pull requests on this README.md or the code if you think it could
use improvement. Happy hacking!
